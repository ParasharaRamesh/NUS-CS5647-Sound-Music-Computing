the test script contains the following steps:
1. load the model weights
2. pass the test dataset path along with other arguments such as :
    - onset threshold of 0.7,
    - offset threshold of 0.5
    - other args
    into the model predictor
3. model.predict works in the following manner:
    - we predict the results for a batch
    - the onset values are thresholded based on the onset threshold value and same for offset
    - pitch and octave values are converted to a number so that all 4 vectors are a list of 250
    - we append this for each batch into a list ( say of 48 batches ) -> (48,250 ) -> then we flatten it out -> (12000,)
    - zip all 4 such 12k's into a frame_info -> 12k of 4 tuple (onset, offset, octave, pitch)
    - we then parse each frame in the following manner and store it in result[#song num] ( i.e. frame level -> note level)
        * for each of the 12k frames
            . each frame is of length 0.02
            . keep a current_onset
            . keep collating values of pitch and octave into a midi number whenever onset is not present
            . the moment an offset is detected at that tuple into result ( curr onset, curr frame, midi )
        * store this in result[#songnum] so we will have it for 5 songs
4. save the midi outputs in ./results/predictions.json
5. Optionally render it as a midi file
6. Use the MIREval class prepare
    - get ground truth note level annotations
    - get the predicted note level annotations
7. MIR accuracy is calculated in the following manner (with a tolerance of 0.1):
    - for each of the 5 songs evaluate it:
        * prepare the data
            . for that song's original and predicted note level annotations get a list of durations(i.e. intervals) and pitch
        * convert pitches into hertz for both original and predicted!
        * compute the MIR metrics taking pitch threshold as 50 ( 0.5 semitones) and onset tolerance as 0.05 (50 ms as per MIR EVAL ), offset ratio 0.2
    - take the metrics out and average it out
    - groid
    - print it out
